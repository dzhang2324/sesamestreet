Replication Code/Paper for Kearney and Levine (2019): Early Childhood Education by Television: Lessons from Sesame Street.

This replication is my share of the work for a final project in STAT156/256 - Causal Inference, done with one other person. I replcate the results in the paper, which are the estimations of two fixed effects regressions, and reanalyze the data in the paper utilizing AIPW/Doubly Robust estimators to estimate the causal effect of interest. All replications are done in R.
